# About The Repository
This repository contains previous versions of Simple Vehicles Add-On which also includes several versions and efforts I did and it was Started in Year 2019 Named as Aspire Vehicles Which is based from the laptop series that I started using to develop this add-on.

# Why This was be Open For Now?
I decide to release the old source code of this Add-On so that anyone can try, see, modify and do whatever they want too 

# Is the Latest One is Available Soon to be Open-Source?
I guess not for now But the Aspire Vehicles and Simple Vehicles Add-on 1 and 2 will be Open Under GPL License but the Version 3 is stayed proprietary 

# To make this clear Simple Vehicles Add-on has several versions as of today and this was based on the Final Builds previously
 - Simple Vehicles Add-on v1: GPL V3
 - Simple Vehicles Add-on v1.7.2-Final: GPL V3
 - Simple Vehicles Add-on v2: --TBA--
 - Simple Vehicles Add-on v3: Proprietary

Tools used for developing such as 
- Blockbench
- VSCode or VSCodium (For Version 1 and Version 2)
- Regolith compiler for development (Faster than bridge v2)
- Bridge V2 (For Version 3)


# What's available in version 2?
This was based from the 1.7.2 in year 2022 after three years these were now on development for the latest stable version of Minecraft Bedrock which requires 1.21 and above and currently in stable versions and trying to jive between Global and China Edition so that's why it's very too long to finish and continue the development for version 3. All Items are now in stable state and works for Minecraft China 1.21 and Global Bedrock 1.21 and Above

# What happen to version 3?
It's still there and stick to 3.6.0 as of now since I've paused it for this development of remake for latest stable versions
